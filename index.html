<h1> Camera Arrays for minimally invasive surgery </h1> 
<p> We attempt to offer an improvement over the traditional single camera set ups currently used in laparoscopic surgery. Our laparoscope array offers an improved field of view over traditional systems and thus will offer a hands free vision system for surgeons attempting the procedure. The system uses a four camera array that expands out from the surgical port to give a panoramic view of the surgical area. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and goals of an improved laparoscope system. We have implemented a basic image stitching algorithm to combine the video feeds from our camera array into a single video feed and a basic projection based view interpolation algorithm to showcase the benefits our system offers over a traditional laparoscope. </p>
